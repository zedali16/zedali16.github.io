I am Assistant Professor of statistics in the Paul H. Chook Department of Information System and Statistics, Zicklin School of Business, Baruch College, CUNY. 

I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from the Department of Statistical Science, Temple Univeristy. My advisors are [William W.S. Wei](https://astro.temple.edu/~wwei/) and [Robert Krafty](https://www.publichealth.pitt.edu/home/directory/robert-krafty). My research interests include: time series analysis, spectral analysis, Nonparametric statistics, Bayesian computational methods, dimension reduction, and variable selection.
